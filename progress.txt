# Ralph Progress Log - Claru Pillar Pages

Project: Build PREPARE, ENRICH, and VALIDATE pillar pages
Branch: ralph/pillar-pages
Started: 2026-01-13

## Reference Implementation
- /src/app/pillars/acquire/page.tsx - Gold standard for all pillar pages
- /src/app/pillars/acquire/layout.tsx - Metadata and JSON-LD schema pattern

## Key Patterns
- Citation component for inline source links with ExternalLink icon
- CapabilityCard component for capabilities grid
- FAQItem component accepts React.ReactNode for JSX answers
- Page flow: Hero → Problem → Market Context → Proof → Capabilities → Process → Use Cases → FAQ → CTA

- Keywords array covering data preparation, ML datasets, deduplication, multimodal alignment
- JSON-LD schema with Service, BreadcrumbList, and FAQPage (5 questions)
- Build passes

### Learnings:
- Follow exact structure from acquire/layout.tsx
- Keep FAQ questions in JSON-LD consistent with page content
- Title must be under 60 chars for SEO

- Proof section with placeholder cards: Foundation Model Lab, Video AI Startup
- Capabilities: Layers (Deduplication), Filter (Quality Filtering), FileText (Format Normalization), Cpu (Multimodal Alignment)
- Process: Data Audit -> Pipeline Configuration -> Processing & Validation -> Delivery & Integration

- FAQ with 5 JSX answers about dedup methods, quality tradeoffs, multimodal, scale, lineage
- CTA: "Stop Fighting Your Data Pipeline"
- 15+ inline citations with real URLs
- Build passes

### Learnings:
- More efficient to create full page.tsx with all sections at once following acquire pattern
- Deduplication stats: 30%+ removal typical, 77% NearDup content has 50+ token exact matches
- RefinedWeb: 5T tokens from CommonCrawl with strict deduplication
- RedPajama-V2: 30T tokens with 40+ quality signals
- SlimPajama: higher information density through extensive deduplication
- Multimodal alignment requires <50ms sync tolerance for video-text
- Key technical terms: MinHashLSH, perplexity scoring, semantic dedup, cross-modal embeddings
- Icons used: Layers, Filter, FileText, Cpu, Video, ChevronRight, ArrowRight, ExternalLink

## US-014: Create VALIDATE layout.tsx with metadata and JSON-LD schema
- Status: COMPLETE
- Created /src/app/pillars/validate/layout.tsx
- Metadata title: "AI Red Teaming & Data Validation | Claru" (under 60 chars)
- Description covers red teaming, benchmark curation, bias detection, safety evaluation
- Keywords: AI red teaming, data validation, benchmark curation, bias detection, AI safety evaluation, adversarial testing, model validation, EU AI Act compliance
- JSON-LD schema with Service (AI Data Validation Services), BreadcrumbList (Home -> Validate), FAQPage (5 questions)
- Build passes

### Learnings:
- Followed exact structure from acquire/layout.tsx
- VALIDATE theme focuses on safety/risk - red teaming, bias, benchmark contamination
- EU AI Act compliance is a key regulatory angle for this pillar

---

## US-012: Create ENRICH layout.tsx with metadata and JSON-LD schema
- Status: COMPLETE
- Created /src/app/pillars/enrich/layout.tsx
- Metadata title: "Expert Data Annotation for AI Labs | Claru" (under 60 chars)
- Description covers RLHF, expert annotation, PhD-level specialists, frame-level video labeling, red teaming
- Keywords: data annotation, RLHF, expert labeling, AI training data, human feedback, preference data, video annotation, red teaming, AI safety
- JSON-LD schema with Service (Expert Data Annotation Services), BreadcrumbList (Home -> Enrich), FAQPage (5 questions)
- Build passes

### Learnings:
- ENRICH pillar is about human intelligence, not just human time
- Key services: RLHF preference data, frame-level video annotation, expert domain annotation, red teaming
- Quality metrics: IAA >85%, Krippendorff's Alpha >0.80

---

## US-013: Create ENRICH page.tsx with full content
- Status: COMPLETE
- Created /src/app/pillars/enrich/page.tsx with all sections
- Hero: "03" pillar number, "ENRICH" TextScramble, "Your Model Is Only as Smart as Its Teachers." subtitle
- Problem section "The Annotation Quality Gap" with Gartner 30% GenAI abandonment stat, Meta Scale AI investment
- Market Context with RLTHF 6-7% efficiency, HackerOne 750+ AI red teamers, video annotation challenges
- Proof section with placeholder cards: Frontier LLM Lab (RLHF), Safety Research Team (red teaming)
- Capabilities: Sparkles (RLHF & Preference), Video (Frame-Level Annotation), Users (Expert Domain), Shield (Red Teaming)
- Process: Requirements Discovery -> Annotator Matching -> Annotation & QA -> Delivery & Iteration
- Use Cases: RLHF for LLMs (IAA, Krippendorff's Alpha), Video Understanding (temporal annotation), Safety & Alignment (red teaming)
- FAQ with 5 JSX answers about expert vs crowd, quality at scale, domain coverage, RLHF process, quality metrics
- CTA: "Stop Settling for Generic Annotation"
- 10+ inline citations with real URLs
- Build passes

### Learnings:
- RLTHF (Targeted Human Feedback) achieves full annotation quality with 6-7% effort - strong efficiency stat
- Meta invested $14.3B in Scale AI (49% stake) - shows annotation market importance
- HackerOne maintains 750+ AI-focused researchers - red teaming becoming standard
- Video annotation: 10-minute video at 30fps = 18,000 frames - quantifies challenge
- Expert STEM annotation commands $40+/hour vs $20 for general tasks
- Inter-annotator agreement thresholds: 85%+ for objective, 0.80+ Krippendorff's Alpha
- Icons used: Sparkles, Video, Users, Shield, MessageSquare, ChevronRight, ArrowRight, ExternalLink

## US-015: Create VALIDATE page.tsx with full content
- Status: COMPLETE
- Created /src/app/pillars/validate/page.tsx with all sections
- Hero: "04" pillar number, "VALIDATE" TextScramble, "Ship Broken Models, Break User Trust." subtitle
- Problem section "The Hidden Quality Crisis" with citations on red team bypass rates, benchmark contamination, and bias
- Market Context with EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, and AI Safety Index citations
- Proof section with placeholder cards: Foundation Model Company, Enterprise AI Team
- Capabilities: ShieldCheck (Red Teaming), Database (Benchmark Curation), Scale (Bias Detection), CheckCircle (Post-Training Eval)

- CTA: "Don't Ship Until You're Sure"
- 9+ inline citations with real URLs
- Build passes

### Learnings:
- Direct-response copy for VALIDATE emphasizes risk/fear (broken models, user trust, regulatory fines)
- Red teaming research shows >90% attack success rates against defenses - strong stat for urgency
- Benchmark contamination is well-documented (100% leakage ratios, 4.9x score inflation)
- EU AI Act has specific deadlines (Aug 2025 GPAI, Aug 2026 high-risk) - useful for urgency
- Bias research has concrete examples (salary recommendations $120K lower for women)
- Icons used: ShieldCheck, Database, Scale, CheckCircle, AlertTriangle, Target
