# Ralph Progress Log - Claru Pillar Pages

Project: Build PREPARE, ENRICH, and VALIDATE pillar pages
Branch: ralph/pillar-pages
Started: 2026-01-13

## Reference Implementation
- /src/app/pillars/acquire/page.tsx - Gold standard for all pillar pages
- /src/app/pillars/acquire/layout.tsx - Metadata and JSON-LD schema pattern

## Key Patterns
- Citation component for inline source links with ExternalLink icon
- CapabilityCard component for capabilities grid
- FAQItem component accepts React.ReactNode for JSX answers
- Page flow: Hero → Problem → Market Context → Proof → Capabilities → Process → Use Cases → FAQ → CTA

## US-001: Create PREPARE layout.tsx with metadata and JSON-LD schema
- Status: COMPLETE
- Created /src/app/pillars/prepare/layout.tsx
- Metadata with title under 60 chars, description 140-160 chars
- Keywords array covering data preparation, ML datasets, deduplication, multimodal alignment
- JSON-LD schema with Service, BreadcrumbList, and FAQPage (5 questions)
- Build passes

### Learnings:
- Follow exact structure from acquire/layout.tsx
- Keep FAQ questions in JSON-LD consistent with page content
- Title must be under 60 chars for SEO

---

## US-014: Create VALIDATE layout.tsx with metadata and JSON-LD schema
- Status: COMPLETE
- Created /src/app/pillars/validate/layout.tsx
- Metadata title: "AI Red Teaming & Data Validation | Claru" (under 60 chars)
- Description covers red teaming, benchmark curation, bias detection, safety evaluation
- Keywords: AI red teaming, data validation, benchmark curation, bias detection, AI safety evaluation, adversarial testing, model validation, EU AI Act compliance
- JSON-LD schema with Service (AI Data Validation Services), BreadcrumbList (Home -> Validate), FAQPage (5 questions)
- Build passes

### Learnings:
- Followed exact structure from acquire/layout.tsx
- VALIDATE theme focuses on safety/risk - red teaming, bias, benchmark contamination
- EU AI Act compliance is a key regulatory angle for this pillar

---

## US-015: Create VALIDATE page.tsx with full content
- Status: COMPLETE
- Created /src/app/pillars/validate/page.tsx with all sections
- Hero: "04" pillar number, "VALIDATE" TextScramble, "Ship Broken Models, Break User Trust." subtitle
- Problem section "The Hidden Quality Crisis" with citations on red team bypass rates, benchmark contamination, and bias
- Market Context with EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, and AI Safety Index citations
- Proof section with placeholder cards: Foundation Model Company, Enterprise AI Team
- Capabilities: ShieldCheck (Red Teaming), Database (Benchmark Curation), Scale (Bias Detection), CheckCircle (Post-Training Eval)
- Process: Scope Definition -> Test Design -> Evaluation Execution -> Reporting & Remediation
- Use Cases: LLM Safety Evaluation, Benchmark Integrity, Bias & Fairness Audits
- FAQ with 5 JSX answers covering red teaming methods, benchmark contamination, bias types, golden sets, EU AI Act compliance
- CTA: "Don't Ship Until You're Sure"
- 9+ inline citations with real URLs
- Build passes

### Learnings:
- Direct-response copy for VALIDATE emphasizes risk/fear (broken models, user trust, regulatory fines)
- Red teaming research shows >90% attack success rates against defenses - strong stat for urgency
- Benchmark contamination is well-documented (100% leakage ratios, 4.9x score inflation)
- EU AI Act has specific deadlines (Aug 2025 GPAI, Aug 2026 high-risk) - useful for urgency
- Bias research has concrete examples (salary recommendations $120K lower for women)
- Icons used: ShieldCheck, Database, Scale, CheckCircle, AlertTriangle, Target
