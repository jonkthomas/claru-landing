# Landing Page Strategy: Claru

## Positioning Analysis

### The Market Reality
AI labs are hitting a data quality wall. Frontier models require:
1. Expert-grade training data (not crowd-sourced noise)
2. Pristine evaluation sets (ground truth for measurement)
3. Fast feedback loops (days, not weeks)
4. Transparent operations (know who labeled what)

### Competitive Landscape
- **Scale AI, Surge AI, etc.**: Transactional, opaque, slow
- **Internal teams**: Hard to scale, expensive, distracted from core R&D
- **Freelance experts**: Inconsistent, no methodology, management overhead

### Claru's Unique Position
"The Human Cortex for Your Digital Brain" - positioned as an extension of the AI team, not a vendor.

## Winning Angle

### Selected Angle: "Glass Box Intelligence"
The opposite of black-box vendors. Claru is transparent, embedded, relational.

**Why This Wins:**
1. Directly addresses the pain (opaque vendors, slow feedback)
2. Creates clear contrast (Black Box vs Glass Box)
3. Implies partnership over transaction
4. Technical audience values transparency

### Headline Direction
Primary: "The Human Cortex for Your Digital Brain."
- Metaphor that technical audience instantly grasps
- Positions Claru as essential infrastructure, not optional service
- Implies biological/digital symbiosis

## Voice Profile

### Tone
- **Technical but accessible**: Speak engineer-to-engineer without jargon walls
- **Confident but not arrogant**: We know our value, no need to oversell
- **Direct**: Short sentences, clear statements, no fluff
- **Slightly provocative**: Challenge the status quo (commodity data, black boxes)

### Vocabulary
**Use:**
- "Embedded", "transparent", "expert-grade", "frontier"
- "Squad", "pod", "team" (relationship language)
- "Ground truth", "evaluation", "methodology" (precision language)
- Technical terms the audience uses (RLHF, CoT, teleoperation)

**Avoid:**
- "Solutions", "synergy", "leverage" (corporate speak)
- "AI-powered" (ironic for a human intelligence company)
- "Best-in-class", "world-class" (empty superlatives)
- Excessive exclamation points or hype

### Rhythm
- Lead with short punchy statements
- Follow with one clarifying sentence
- End sections with memorable one-liners
- Use numbered lists for scannable structure

## Message Architecture

### Primary Value Proposition
"Expert-grade human intelligence, embedded in your workflow, with total transparency."

### Three Pillars
1. **The Golden Set** - Pristine evaluation data
2. **The Embedded Squad** - Experts in your Slack
3. **The Frontier Standard** - Battle-tested methodologies

### Proof Points
- Built by teams from frontier AI labs
- Trusted by Reka AI, Moonvalley
- Real names, real experts, real accountability

## Conversion Strategy

### Primary Path
1. Hero establishes the problem and solution
2. Wedge section explains the three offerings
3. Paradigm Shift creates clear contrast with competitors
4. Capabilities prove breadth of expertise
5. Testimonial builds trust
6. Final CTA captures lead

### Form Strategy
Terminal-aesthetic form that feels native to the design:
- Progressive disclosure (one question at a time)
- Smart qualifying questions (use case, model type, timeline)
- Feels like a conversation, not a form

### CTA Language
- Primary: "Initialize Your Squad" (technical, action-oriented)
- Secondary: "Talk to an Expert" (lower commitment)
- Both lead to same form with different pre-fill or context
