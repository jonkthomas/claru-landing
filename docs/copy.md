## TESTIMONIALS SECTION

**Section Headline:**
Built for the Labs Building the Future.

### Primary Testimonial

**Quote:**
"We were building video generation models and hit a wall. Traditional data vendors gave us inconsistent quality and zero context. Claru dropped a squad of visual effects experts into our Slack channel. They understood our architecture, joined our syncs, and helped us ship features we'd been stuck on for months. They're not a vendor - they're part of the team now."

### Secondary Testimonial

**Quote:**
"The difference is night and day. With our previous vendor, we'd wait a week for labeled data, then spend another week fixing errors. With Claru, our experts are in our standup every morning. When there's an edge case, we debug it together in real-time."
