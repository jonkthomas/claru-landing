            text: "Video annotation adds temporal complexity. A 10-minute video at 30 fps contains 18,000 frames that must be labeled consistently. Annotators must track objects across frames, identify when actions begin and end, and maintain label consistency through occlusions and scene changes. Unlike images, video requires understanding of motion, physics, and temporal relationships.",

            "@type": "Answer",
            text: "Temporal consistency comes from specialized tooling and trained annotators. We use interpolation-aware annotation platforms that propagate labels across frames, employ annotators trained on temporal consistency requirements, and run automated QA checks that flag frame-to-frame inconsistencies. Multi-annotator consensus resolves ambiguous boundaries.",
